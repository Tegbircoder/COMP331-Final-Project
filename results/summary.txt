DATA QUALITY ANALYSIS SUMMARY - GLOBAL SUPERSTORE DATASET
================================================================

DATASET OVERVIEW:
- Total Records: 51,290
- Total Columns: 23
- Data Source: Global Superstore Sales Data

================================================================
DIMENSION 1: COMPLETENESS
================================================================
[OK] Overall Completeness: 100%
[OK] No NULL values found
[OK] No empty strings or placeholder values

================================================================
DIMENSION 2: CONSISTENCY
================================================================
[ISSUE] Product ID Inconsistency

- 457 Product IDs have multiple different Product Names
- This creates 476 extra records when building DIM_PRODUCT
- Example: Product ID 'FUR-BO-10000087' has 2 names:
  - Dania Classic Bookcase, Mobile
  - Sauder Corner Shelving, Pine

IMPACT ON DATA WAREHOUSING:
- Violates dimension table integrity
- Creates duplicate dimension records
- Causes inconsistent reporting
- Breaks star schema design principles

OTHER FINDINGS:
- 63 cities appear in multiple countries (valid - same city name)
- 12,544 records (24.5%) have negative profit (valid - losses)
- Discounts range from 0% to 85%

================================================================
DIMENSION 3: VALIDITY
================================================================
[OK] All categorical values are valid:
- 3 Categories: Office Supplies, Technology, Furniture
- 3 Segments: Consumer, Corporate, Home Office
- 4 Ship Modes: Standard, First, Second, Same Day
- 4 Priorities: Low, Medium, High, Critical

[OK] Date logic is valid:
- All Ship Dates are on or after Order Dates
- Shipping time: 0-7 days (average 4 days)

================================================================
REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY
================================================================
[ISSUE] DIM_PRODUCT table would have integrity problems

- 10,292 unique Product IDs exist
- But 10,768 dimension records would be created
- 476 duplicate records due to inconsistent names

================================================================
KEY FINDING FOR REPORT
================================================================
The main data quality issue is CONSISTENCY in the Product dimension.
457 products have multiple names for the same Product ID, which would
create 476 duplicate records in a star schema, violating referential
integrity and causing unreliable business intelligence reports.
